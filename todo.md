## Camera
- ~~Camera positioning (try odd canvasses?)~~

## Global illumination
- ~~Sphere illumination in darkness (ignore very close bounces)~~
- ~~Make sure the bouncing directions are calculated correctly~~

## Local illumination
- ~~Antialiasing~~
- ~~Area lights `usecenter`~~
- ~~Check which lights to get shadows from (add contribution from one to the other)~~
- ~~Make sure using Hâ€¢N is correct (diffuse may not be correct)~~
